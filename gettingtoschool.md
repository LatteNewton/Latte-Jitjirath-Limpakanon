Wake up
Drink water from by water bottle next to my bed
Turn on the lights next to me so I can see in such a dark room
I walk to my closet and get dressed
I walk out of the room and I enter the bathroom
I brush my teeth and shower
I leave the bathroom and I walk down to have my breakfast
After I'm done eating my breakfast I walk to the car
I enter the car
I sit in the car until I arrive at school
I walk out of the car and wait for elevator
Later, I enter the elevator
Then the elevator takes me up
I walked in to the lobby room and login using my card
I walk in to my study room and that's how I get to school
