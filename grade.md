The flowchart system starts by a number being present on the 'input testScore' section.
After a certain number from the range of 0-100 is inputted, the system starts scanning the score and grades the scores.
If the number inputted is greater than '80' the output will come out as 'Output A'
If the number inputted is greater than '70' the output will come out as 'Output B'
If the number inputted is greater than '60' the output will come out as 'Output C'
If the number inputted is greater than '0' the output will come out as 'Output D'
If the number inputted is '0' then the score will be displaying: 'FAIL'
After that, the system ends.
